# Inverse Kinematics - Unreal Engine 5.5.2
 My assignment to build a poseable character with scripted animation of arm movement and any other simple animation in Unreal Engine. The scripted animation of the arm has to be built using Inverse Kinematics. Here I have used FABRIK Algorithm for 3 Bone Inverse Kinematics animation.
